# Welcome to the Studio Gradients Wordpress Test


Clone this repo which is a simplified version of the Studio Gradients site

You shouldnâ€™t need to install anything. If you need to make changes to any of the style components, run `sass --watch main.scss main.css --style compressed`, and all images can be found in the `img` folder.

The goal of this test is to replicate the current site while integrating with Wordpress. Ultimately, we are testing your knowledge of Wordpress or your ability to learn it. If styles get messed up in the process, that is okay. If you want to reuse some images for ease, that is also okay.
